## Overview

With the advent of Bitcoin, a cryptographically-enabled peer-to-peer digital payment system, blockchain together with a whole package of distributed ledger technologies, which serve as the underlying foundation of all the crypto-currencies, have been gaining attention from both academia and industry in the last decade. Furthermore, the recent years have witnessed tremendous momentum in the development of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies， largely due to the impressive rise in the market capital of these digital tokens.  More and more industries, from banking and insurance, to supply chain and e-commerce, are quickly realizing the great potential in blockchain technology in efficiency boost, process automation and secure data sharing across otherwise isolated data silos.  

Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust one another to maintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. Most attention and research so far have been devoted to the underlying technologies from the database, distributed architecture, cryptography and consensus aspects, primarily because the priority as yet has been attached to the feasibility, stability and scalability of the platforms.  Yet, as it has been gaining increasing awareness that the greatest potential of blockchain and distributed technologies lies in unleashing a whole new economy empowered by the capabilities to convert a rich class of emerging class of virtual assets into attributable value, including a long list of promising new concepts such as influence, social capital, swarm intelligence, personal data and credit.  How to bring the greatest value out of the various types of new “on-chain” data in the blockchain setting becomes an urgent task.  Consequently, it is both important and challenging to explore a wealth of interesting new research topics in this new setting that fall broadly under the scope of KDD yet with the unique requirement to achieve the optimal balance among data utility, security and privacy.  
 
The workshop aims to provide a venue at SIGKDD for developers, practitioners, and researchers from different background to discuss how the unique properties of blockchain and distributed ledger that benefit current and future applications, particular from the perspective of integrating data mining, analysis and intelligence into the underlying framework.   To best integrate with KDD community and scope, we have proposed the special theme of “Smart Data” to highlight the mission and focus of this workshop.  Due to COVID-19 situation, this year's workshop will be held online on August 24, 20120 in conjunction with the ACM SIGKDD 2020.
